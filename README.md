My optimizating compiler for the Bril programming language from the [CS 6120 course](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2020fa/self-guided/). See `src` for various optimizations.

The libraries `brilirs` and `bril-rs`, as well as `samples` are forked from the [course repo](https://github.com/sampsyo/cs6120). Bril-rs includes my own modifications in the form of helper methods.
